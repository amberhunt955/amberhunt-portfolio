<!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->

## What did I learn while creating this website?

<p>CSS, CSS, CSS! As much as I love CSS, I spent a lot of time making mistakes - but also learning from them. <br/>

The background photo on the main page took me a long time to get right. I have quite a few ~experimental~ commits because I couldn't figure out why the page would appear one way for phones in Chrome dev tools, but another way on my actual device. Eventually I realized that for some reason, apple devices in particular were displaying the "fixed" position differently. So, removing the fixed position for mobile screens solved my issue.
<br/>

Another issue I THOUGHT I had was with flex box gaps on larger screens. For some reason, they wouldn't display, but eventually I realized the version of Safari on my parent's older mac just didn't support flex box gaps.
<br/>

I'm pretty proud of my NavBar. It is simple but it also really helped me understand how useState hooks. Between the drop down menu on the home page and the changing icons, it was a great learning process. My footer was also a great lesson for useState and useEffect.</p>

<!-- FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS -->

## What's coming next?

There are still a lot of improvements I would like to make.

<li>On the home page, I want to have the content fade in as you scroll to each section</li>

<li>I'd love for the footer to gracefully move into position on scroll up, rather than just appearing</li>

<li>I'm still fine-tuning the overall responsiveness across devices</li>

<li>I'd like to add some personal photos to the gallery from my adventures</li>

<li>I also want to transform this into a portfolio site / blog</li>
