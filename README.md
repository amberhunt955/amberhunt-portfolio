<!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
## What did I learn while creating this website?

<p>CSS, CSS, CSS! As much as I love CSS, I spent a lot of time making mistakes - but also learning from them. The background photo on the main page took me a long time to get right. I have quite a few ~experimental~ commits because I couldn't figure out why the page would appear one way for phones in Chrome dev tools, but another way on my actual device. Eventually I realized that for some reason, apple devices in particular were displaying the "fixed" position differently. So removing the fixed position for mobile screens solved my issue</p>

<p>I'm pretty proud of my NavBar. It is simple but it also really helped me understand how useState hooks. Between the drop down menu on the home page and the changing icons, it was a great learning process. My footer was also a great lesson for useState and useEffect.</p>

<!-- FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS -->
## What's coming next?

<p>There are still a lot of improvements I would like to make. The work never ends! On the home page, I want to have the content fade in as you scroll to each section. I also want to find a way to have the footer appear every time you visit the very bottom of the page - but also keep the currently functionality on other parts of the page where it only appears on up scrolls.</p>

<p>I'm still fine-tuning the overall responsiveness with font sizes. But so far, I'm pretty happy with how it translates across devices</p>

<p>Eventually, I will also add some personal photos to the gallery from my adventures. I also want to create a blog.</p>
