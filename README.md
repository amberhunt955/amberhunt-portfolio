<!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->

## What did I learn while creating this website?

<p>Probably the biggest learning curve with this project was CSS. I spent a lot of time making mistakes here - but also learning from them. This portfolio project in particular has contributed to a massive improvement of my CSS skills, and it's exciting to finally be able to bring the designs I envision to reality.<br/>

My NavBar is simple, but really helped me understand how useState works. Between the drop down menu on the home page, and the changing icons, it was a great learning process. My footer was also a great lesson for useState and useEffect.<br/>

I have spent far, far too much time trying to make the website design look good across devices. Lesson learned, and next time I'll definitely be taking a mobile-first approach.<br/>

Some notes:<br/>

<li>The background photo on the main page took me a long time to get right. I have quite a few experimental commits from when I couldn't figure out why the page was appearing one way in Chrome dev tools, but another way on my actual device. Eventually I realized that apple mobile devices in particular were displaying the "fixed" position differently. As this feature wasn't entirely necessary, removing the fixed position for mobile sized screens solved my issue.</li>

<li>Another issue I THOUGHT I had was with flex box gaps on larger screens. For some reason, they wouldn't display, but eventually I realized the version of Safari on the older mac I was using just didn't support flex box gaps.</li>
</p>

<!-- FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS -->

## What's coming next?

There are still a lot of improvements I would like to make:

<li>As I've expanded my skills since creating this project, I'm currently in the process of refactoring my code and making it cleaner and more readable to other developers</li>

<li>On the home page, I want to have the content fade in as you scroll to each section</li>

<li>I'd love for the footer to gracefully move into position on scroll up, rather than just appearing</li>

<li>I'm still fine-tuning the overall responsiveness across devices</li>

<li>I'd like to add some personal photos to the gallery from my adventures</li>

<li>I also want to transform this into a portfolio site / blog</li>
