        Hey there! I'm Amber, a motivated and dedicated software developer based in Columbus, Ohio.
        <br />
        <br />
        I thrive on creating innovative web applications utilizing the MERN stack, and I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow in my
        craft. With a passion for solving complex problems and creating user-friendly experiences, I approach every project with a commitment to
        delivering high-quality solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding, you might find me scaling the walls of a rock climbing gym, lost in a good book, or delving into the complexities of
        learning a new (human) language. My drive to continually learn and improve translates into my work as a software developer. Let's work
        together to bring your next project to life!
