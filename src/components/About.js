        I am a Software Developer from Columbus, Ohio, currently in a rigorous full-time Software Engineering program at Per Scholas.
        <br /><br />
        My coding journey began when I was in college at Miami University. I took several computer science courses and learned HTML, CSS and the
        fundamentals of Java and C++. After graduation I decided to explore other opportunities and moved to Toronto, Canada on a temporary Working
        Holiday Visa. While in Canada I had multiple work experiences, but my main roles were as an Assistant Program Coordinator at SWAP Working
        Holidays, and as the Head Instructor and Program Administrator for the Learn to Skate program at the Harbourfront Centre.
        <br /><br />
        When my Canadian visa expired I traveled for a few years, ending up in New Zealand on another Working Holiday Visa. I arrived just a few
        months before the pandemic began and worked in various seasonal farm roles around the country for almost 3 years. Towards the end of my time
        in New Zealand I realized that my favorite thing to do in any job is problem solve, and so I decided to try and get back into coding. While
        researching my options, I came across Per Scholas and applied to their Software Engineering program. I was incredibly excited to be accepted,
        and I’m thrilled to finally begin my software development journey!
        <br /><br />
        When I’m not coding, you can find me learning something. I am always interested in trying new things and challenging myself by expanding my
        skills - whether it is a mental challenge, like learning another language, or physical, like indoor rock climbing. I love to travel and
        experience different cultures and ways of thinking. I am often trying to make the best cup of coffee, or the best cupcake of all time, but
        rarely am I satisfied with my results. There is always something to be improved upon!
